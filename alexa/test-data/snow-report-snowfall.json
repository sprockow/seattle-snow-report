    "description": "We had big smiles while riding down some amazing groomers yesterday from the cold temperature keeping all the new snow that we have gotten over the past week nice and playful. The sun was replaced by clouds later in the day but that didn't stop people from finding some leftover pow pockets. For today we are expecting it to be mostly cloudy with the sun occasionally peaking out to give us some relief from the cold temperatures. The groomed runs are going to be amazing today which in turn means the terrain park is going to be firing on all cylinders. See you on the hill!\n\nEarly season conditions still exist, so please ski and board with caution.",
